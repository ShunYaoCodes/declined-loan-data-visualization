# Declined Loan Data Visualization
##### A Python program to visualize declined loan data using Pandas and Bokeh.
##### This was my final project in the data visualization course of MS in Information Systems at Baruch College.
##### The data files can be downloaded at "DECLINED LOAN DATA" section on https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action
##### The program runs on Bokeh server: open Anaconda Prompt, go to the folder containing the code file, type bokeh serve --show Reject_stats.py and enter
##### The data files are over 1.2 GB, depends on computer specification, it may take a long time for the program and the server to load and run
